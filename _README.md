# MLpractice
Introduction: This is my assignments and practices on purpose of taking a step into Data Science & Machine Learning career. Since those are very simple practices, I don't consider them as projects but just some practices. However, this one are my initial step to DS & ML that I am excited to show you. In each file, there are introduction and my comments and explanations and conclusions for what I understand about those agorithms.

This includes 6 small practices in DS&ML, and one funny code I use to learn English (but it was a little bit fail haha).

**Brief:

**#file0**: English funny code (you can skip this haha)

**#file1**: Simple analyzed a dataset of Terorrism without any agorithm inside, just analyzed and visualized

**#file2**: Linear regression for admission prediction. In this I used 3 methods: Libraries imported (sklearn), normal equation, and gradient descent

**#file3**: Logistic regression for famous dataset Titanic. This use 2 method: Sklearn & gradient descent.

**#file4**: Using Bag of words method for sentimental analysis. The dataset has 1,600,000 lines of Twitter tweet (source Kaggle)

**#file5**: KNN for toxic mushroom prediction

**file6**: Hand-digits (MNIST) detection using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression

Some additional information about my learning now:

Right now I am testing some of the Neural Network algorithms I have just learnt from VietAI, including CNN and RNN. VietAI is a course taught student build model by rebuild it by algorithms (not imported libraries). But unfortunately I consider myself not clearly understand those algorithms enough to put it here that I should spend time to learn more. And I am trying to comprehense it via Mr.Andrew Ng's epic course Coursera Machine Learning.

I hope that those simple assignments I uploaded in here can help you understand more about my learning situation now and get deeper understanding abotu myself
