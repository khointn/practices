# SQLpractice

This is my final assigment for Coursera course "Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python" hosted by IBM. The assignment concluded what I have learned from this course.

Key takeaways from this course are:
* Analyze data within a database using SQL and Python.
* Create a relational database on Cloud and work with tables.
* Compare and contrast DDL to DML.
* Write SQL statements including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
