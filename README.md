# MLpractice

Nothing big here, it's just a compilation my favourite self-practice exercise that I had done during my learning process. This compilation includes:
* Skeleton Extraction using BlazePose (2022): BlazePose is a Google API that have pre-trained computer vision models. I did some fun lines of code to draw skeletons of yoga posing videos for a project in school.

* Final Project for CECS1020 - Intro to ML class (2021): The Titanic problem is a newbie practice in ML, we try our best to do some preprocessing & normalizing techniques to make our work to have higher quality than just importing the dataset and run some regression. We got top 5% on Kaggle.
* CBOW - Sentimental Analysis (2020): A simple model to analyze sentiment from Twitter tweets. 
* Hand-digit Recognition MNIST (2020)
